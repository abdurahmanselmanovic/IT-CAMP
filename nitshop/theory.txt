In react.js, a component is a piece of code that represents a part of a user interface.
It can be a class component or a functional component.
Class component is a js class that extents react.component class, while a functional component is a js
function that returns only the react element.

A pureComponent is a special type of component that is similar to a component, but with additional features 
or optimizations. When a component is a pureComponent, react will do a shallow comparasion of the props and state before re-rendering the component. That means that if props and state have not changed, the component wwill not be re-rendering. This can lead to a perfomance boost in some cases, but if it's not used properly, it can lead to unexpected behaviour.

Bottomline, a component is the most basic and most used for building a block in react and pure component is used when it needs some special optimizations.
